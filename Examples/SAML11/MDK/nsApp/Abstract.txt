This example project shows the TrustZone setup for Microchip
Cortex-M23 based ATSAML11E16A device on SAML11-XPRO development board.

The application demonstrates function calls between secure and non-secure states.

Secure application (sApp):
 - Setup code and start non-secure application.
 - Implements secure functions and interface callable from non-secure application

Non-secure application (nsApp):
 - Calls a secure function from non-secure state.

Output:
Variables used in this application can be viewed in the Debugger Watch window.

Notes: 
 - Debug flash sequences are enabled to allow device programming. See "Options for Target.."=> "Debug" tab => "Settings.." button => "Pack" tab.

 - The debugger configurations as well as UROW and BOCOR parameters are done in sApp\DebugConfig\SAML11_s_ATSAML11E16A.dbgconf
   and in nsApp\DebugConfig\SAML11_ns_ATSAML11E16A.dbgconf files.

 - SAML11 device programming in uVision is explained in Application Note 315: www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_315.asp
