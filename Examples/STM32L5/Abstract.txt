The 'S_NS_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32L552ZE' microcontroller using ST 'STM32L522E-EVAL' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    = MSI     =   4 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           110 MHz

The example demonstrates the interworking between secure and un-secure mode
on an ST 'STM32L552ZE' Cortex-M33 microcontroller.

The S_NS_Blinky application is available for targets:

  Debug: configured for Debugging (uses ULINK2 as debugger)


--------------------------------------------

Secure Application:
 Setup core.
 Initialize LEDs.
 Configure SystemCoreClock.
 LD3:  function call from Secure to NonSecure code via registered function pointer using Secure SysTick.

NonSecure Application:
 LD2:  function call from NonSecure to Secure Code via exported Secure functions  using NonSecure SysTick.
 LD1:  function call from NonSecure to Secure code via exported Secure functions  using while loop.


--------------------------------------------

User Option Bytes configuration:
STM32L5xx User Option Bytes should be set according the application configuration.
The proper User Option Bytes setup is in line with the project linker/scatter file.
    TZEN=1
    DBANK=1
    SECWM1_STRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0x7F   meaning all 128 pages of Bank1 set as secure
    SECWM2_STRT=0x1  SECWM1_PEND=0x0    meaning no page of Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure
